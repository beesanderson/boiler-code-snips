# How to GitHub 101 
Below is my *Step by Step Guide on how to Download and Edit a Public Repository on GitHub* for beginner developers. This Guide links to several GitHub Docs I wish that someone had directed me to when I was an absolutely "green" developer myself. To avoid that happening to you let me be the *first* (or...possibly the first?) to compile then share with you! :D 

I used to be an assistant preschool & Kindergarten teacher which has *weirdly* taught me how to teach and (in previous management positions I've had,) train adults. I know what it's like to be (or **FEEL**) young, "dumb," and terrified of what you have to do. That's overwhelming for anyone. Everyone knows what it's like to feel small, intimidated, and inadequate. There are a lot of us around you, *ahem yoooðŸ¤“*, who have made it one of our missions & goals in life to help teach what we know in a way that would have helped us while we were, ourselves, learning it. I hope to be able to do that one day. 



## To Git or not to Git...that is the question (except you will need to GIT)
- (In all seriousness, always [Git](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-git-learn-git-version-control/#:~:text=Git%20is%20a%20version%20control,when%20those%20changes%20were%20made.)...it's kind of a big deal) 
My "*How to Git*" Guide is in the works (aka WIP.) In the meantime please read some of these links for further insight and understanding into what "[Git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdAHXoRtos)" and what "[Git-ting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVRQoVRzMIY&t=1559s)" (shh it's a word because I used it shh) is and thus what GitHub is and why we all use it...and are terrified of ðŸ˜±[GitHub Copilot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4duqI8WyfqE)ðŸ˜±) 
###### ....shh...don't say it's name to loud otherwise it will hear you...I'm sure it's learned how to replicate then code its own ears by now

- ** PS [Tech with Tim](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg) straight up taught me how to use Git. This kid is stellar. He is primarily a Python Developer but he's still a great resource, especially for something like Git. He's also got a couple JavaScript "courses" (aka youtube videos.) I'll include him (and countless others) in my upcoming "Instructors to Die For" (or something equally as click-bait-y but accurately titled) resource section to come.  


- ** PPS [GitHub CoPilot](https://www.sitepoint.com/github-copilot-ai-pair-programming/) is actually really impressive and it will really increase productivity. I was just joking before, the tech is AMAZING and potential LIMITLESS! 




## Now for the actual Tutorial

I develop all of my projects using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my [Source Code](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-use-of-code-editor) Editor. Please refer to link for further detail (if you're a entry level beginner.) 

- (I will also be creating a "*Beginner's Guide to Text Editors*" ASAP. This will be a walk through/quick lesson on code editors (mainly [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)and [CodePen](https://codepen.io/).) What they are, how to use them, the different options, and how to use the most beginner friendly ones. My personal preference for "Entry Level" Devs is [CodePen](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-codepen/) as it was the only way I was able to code when I first started...because I was thrown into a lake to learn how to swim as I fondly put it...**shivers**. There are *TONS* of resources out there like this but let me be the first to tell you...THEY ARE HARD TO FIND as a "rookie." Personally for me, all the videos or articles I was able to find were not beginner friendly. Either everyone tries to sell you something or promote an extension (that I didn't even know what the purpose for was because I didn't understand *ANYTHING*!) BTW I'm all about extensions, they are *truly* life savers. As a beginner you don't need to be taught all of that...it's to much to fast and to intimidating...you just need to know how to use the programs basic functionality.)



First things first...[What is a Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories) and what is a [Remote Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories) and how do I download one? To create your **first repository** *AND* impress your friends, please check out [this walk through from GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) to get started :D 

## To run: 
1. To download and edit this code yourself, you may [clone this repository](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5143119/what-does-cloning-a-github-repository-mean) or [download the zip file](https://www.howtogeek.com/178146/htg-explains-everything-you-need-to-know-about-zipped-files/) or [use a password protected SSH Key](https://jdblischak.github.io/2014-09-18-chicago/novice/git/05-sshkeys.html#:~:text=An%20SSH%20key%20is%20an,%2C%20you're%20granted%20access.) for extra security. (Not very beginner friendly...and honestly not needed for something like this.)
2. To [clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) please refer to GitHub Docs's "How To" article previously linked. This is a step by step guide that will walk you through the basics of cloning and then opening another user's GitHub Repository. 
  - You may also download the [Zip File](https://www.itprotoday.com/development-techniques-and-management/how-do-i-download-files-github) which will download a compressed version of the source code for this project that you can open on your preferred code editor. (** Mine is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 
  -   - You may also select the SSH Key option. You will have to make sure you have the correct credentials in order to do so beforehard (as this option grants you added security when interacting with public repositories and cause you to need a key for each "pull/push" request.) See [SSH Key How To](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) for a Step by Step Guide from GitHub Docs on how to do this.
  - ** though VS Code is very straight forward and easy to use it may or may not be the best format for you to start off with. I know when I first downloaded it I was so overwhelmed and had a surprisingly difficult time finding decent and "Entry Level" friendly tutorials on how to use it that weren't convuluted, long, promotion heavy, or etc. I've personally found [CodePen.com](https://codepen.io/pen/) the most straightforward, easy to use, and beginner friendly...at least for me as I am queen of the Silly Billy's! ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‰ If you're at that entry level know I WAS THERE MYSELF TOO and before you know it you'll be writing your own JavaScript Snake Game like I did ðŸ¥²

2. If you have the VS Code extension, [Live Server](ritwickdey.liveserver), it will be incredibly easy for you to start up the web app! Simply right click while in the `index.html` file (located in the [root of the project](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-root-folder-or-root-directory-2625989), or "fancy dev talk" meaning in the default or ["parent" folder](https://www.yourdictionary.com/parent-folder),) you will be able to find the "*Open With Live Server*" option. If you don't have this extension downloaded, please consider it as it makes Front-End Development much more easy and convenient! [Watch this Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzE0yqwbdgU) on a quick tutorial on how to do this for further instruction. 

3. From there you should be able to check it out for yourself! Give it a try and let me know what you think! PS --- AWESOME JOB!!!!
