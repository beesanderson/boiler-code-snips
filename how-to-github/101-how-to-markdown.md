# How To | Mark Down | => 

# WIP Refactor

Check out [GitHub's MarkDown Syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) or MarkDown Guide [for some basic syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). 

For a full (albeit *exhaustive*) breakdown on all things MarkDown File related, check out the [MarkDownGuide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) for some **very** useful but also **very** thorough information. 

** but most importantly check this out [MarkDown Emoji Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md) and emoji freely(BUT responsibly)!! 

 
A super duper awesome resource I had come across relatively recently is the [DevCheckLists](https://devchecklists.com/markdown-devchecklists/) website that was **exactly** what I had been looking for at the time! Now...if only they had a print friendly version for my binders...hmmmm...



### **To Add New Section...** 

```md
Write out the topic as a HEADER that's related to your resource if not otherwise found by choosing a spot and using a double ## hashtag in a new line--
## You're Topic

And to post a named link it's just as simple! A bracket houses the displayed text/name of link [] and parenthesis () hold the link! This will be inline written inline, not on a separate line like the previous. Like so --- []()

Now with text ---
[ My Link Text Here ]( www.I-am-a-link-but-hopefully-not.com ) but without spaces! :D 

[Your Link Text Here](www.GitHub.com)

Use * * to place emphasis to a letter, word, phrase, sentence, or paragraph using italics. 
I'm *emphasizing these* words but not these! 

Use ** ** to make any letter, word, phrase, sentence, or paragraph bold. 
This is an **example of bold text** in a sentence! 

It's all pretty straight forward from there! You can make numbered lists and bullet points with entering a 1(one) and a .(period) with a space after and boom you've started a numbered list that will increment on each enter!
1. 

And boom! You know your first format programming language!
