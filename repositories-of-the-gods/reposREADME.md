# Repositories that may or may not save your life some day...

Still WIP **BUT** I must share the most delicious and useful of all the repositories I have ever encountered! 


It is from, of course...the one--the only [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy) who is one of the most detail oriented, loving, and patient YouTube Instructors I have ever come across (the only other being, of course, Mr. [Kevin Powell](https://github.com/kevin-powell) himself, aka the CSS King.) Now they are **both** very *thourough* so if you're looking for a quick tutorial these two are typically not the ones to go to. If you're looking to *truly & deeply* understand some complex subjects or learn to love HTML & CSS then look no further, these two are you guys <3


But as for the best repository in the entire world here it is....

## King of Repos === [Design Resources for Developers](https://github.com/bradtraversy/design-resources-for-developers) by Brad Traversy ([Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia))

....and just like that Brad won GitHub. It's over guys. We can go home. He's done it.
