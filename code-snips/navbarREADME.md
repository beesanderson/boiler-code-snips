# Code Snips Coming...

I promise. Until then...enjoy this [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjkdUkOYP4g&t=24s) I used to play on my phone ever so softly and hide random places to confuse my siblings as a wee lass...aka still do. 

## CodeSnip Current|Future|IDEAL Format: 

Each code snip will (*ideally*) have --

1. A README.md file that will include a...
- Screenshot demo of asset
- Quick "Copy'n'Paste" code format from .md file
- Assets, Links to helpful "HowTos" or Original Code Source
- Notes during Refactoring Process 
- FAQs Section
- Known Bugs or Problems

2. Files - HTML | CSS | JavaScript | ETC  
(with all related code and refactoring linked if needed in comments)

3. Used Assets - CDNs | Templates | Videos | Magic | Sorcery | & Otherwise Serendipitous Seemingly *Esoteric* Methods

4. I just felt like there should be four...I need sleep...badly. lol 


## *Hang tight...*
I'll also create a little table of contents dashboard once I, you know, *actually have enough snips to link to*) because that just seems like the wise and "Bridgette" thing to do. 


#### Happy Coding!!
