# This folder is for **Development** && **Team** 

## I ORIGINALLY MADE THIS FOR A GROUP PROJECT I'M WORKING ON IN AN ALL FEMALE DEV TEAM, IT NEEDS TO BE REFACTORED FOR GENERAL USE STILL :D 

### Working in a group can be hard! 
There are frequent breakdowns in communication *without* being separated by thousands of miles plus multiple timezones. To try to help us to limit these unavoidable situations I came up with a "*Developer Helps||Team Notes*" folder structure. I know there are a couple of us on the team that can be overly detailed and analytical (**ahem, totally not me, and only me, Bridgette Sanderson...**) to the point of important information being lost in translation due to detail and ever-scrolling threads. 

>It is meant solely as a resource and is only here to help as it exists to *aid* us not *hinder* us. Don't feel pressured to contribute or otherwise document anything that you wouldn't normally do yourself nor ration out time and focus into doing so over something else unless you deem it **(see reference at document end) **helpful to the group as a whole** to do so. Matters like assets, extensive bugs, possible code refactor needed, or explaining the reason behind abrogating from an agreed upon team workflow or feature. 

Once this app is ready for production we can add this to the `.gitignore` file. You can learn more about what "git ignore" is and how to use a [.gitignore file here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files). It is fairly straight forward but can be easy to forget as a beginner but is best practice to get in the habit of early on. There are tons of helpful configurations in the [`github/gitignore` public repo](https://github.com/github/gitignore). 


## How it's (*initially*) structured...

- I've made one folder the root, `/dev-documentation`, which then contains several sub-folders to aid in organization (but **hopefully** doesn't aid in things getting lost or overlooked!) As of initial group repository setup on 12/2/2021 they are as follows `/assets | /bugs | team-faqs` and finally as its own solo file in the parent folder's root for simplicity++ ease of access, `resources-and-helps.md` in which team members are free to link to any and all helpful resources both for this project and future ones. 
    - These could even include links to our Google Docs folder for ease of access once again! 


#### For your consideration || group vote...

- Honestly, GitHub is a **one stop shop** for most of these types of things but personally, never having worked on a group project this large in scale before, I have no idea what to expect. The retail management experience (*plus* former early education teacher) in me is coming out to preemptively maintain order, structure, and most importantly, **communication** and ensure its as easy and accessible as possible. 

- We could possibly consider making a "what I did today|tonight|this morning" area to keep each other posted but I think that between our Slack channels and being smaller group this should be covered.

## How to use...

Just "do you!" There's no wrong way to use this! You can make your own folder (*Lord knows I'm going to need my own...Leslie Knope's lesser known sister here, **sigh***), you can make your own files on whatever topic or area you'd like or deem beneficial. You're all capable super women who could do **ALL** of this without me or this group...just do what you normally do in development and keep the overall group benefit in mind :D 

#### Suggestions or Tips..
Refer to any of our Google Docs to access workflows, task sign-up sheets, notes from meetings (missed or present for), WE HAVE ALSO MOVED ALL THINGS IN GOOGLE DOCS TO OUR [**NOTION**](www.notion.com) CHANNEL!! This is the best "one stop shop" for team projects that I've ever seen and was recommended to our team by [Jasmine Reese](https://github.com/Jasmine582)











##### **** This consists of items such as...**assets** - listing or linking any assets used in development that are not otherwise easily detectable through another avenue. Most importantly, listing or linking to appropriate copyright guidelines and use direction if needed. (i.e. "*free to use when owner|author|developer|designer is attributed" etc*.) **bugs** - this is to help avoid any run-on or extensive code comments and can truly help others, *especially our Senior and Junior team members*, to not only *fix* and *debug* but to **effectively teach us** how to debug logically and syntactically.
