[Coding Mentor Program](https://github.com/Coding-Mentor-Program) but to be fair we are still in the *literally* infancy stages of development. I'm the Project Manager for this project. We are going to be developing a Mental Health Portal App using 
- HTML CSS JavaScript NodeJS ExpressJS ReactJS graphSQL ++more. Hold tight for more.
