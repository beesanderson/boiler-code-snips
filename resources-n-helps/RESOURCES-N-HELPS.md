# Resources && Helps

## I ORIGINALLY MADE THIS FOR A GROUP PROJECT I'M WORKING ON IN AN ALL FEMALE DEV TEAM, IT NEEDS TO BE REFACTORED FOR GENERAL USE STILL :D 

Feel free to scroll and browse! Post any links that you've personally found helpful that might benefit not just our personal team but future beginner women developers seeking the same thing we are...

    ...to learn to code and then to use that code for good <3 (while eating tacos, probably!)

If you're new to Mark Down syntax scroll to the bottom of the page and follow my little "How to |Mark Down|" section at the end of this document! 

#### ------------ **LINKS SPECIFIC TO PROJECT AFTER GENERAL RESOURCES SECTION** ------------



## How to Contribute::

As straightforward as you've assumed! Just copy and past any links, directions, tips or tricks, repositories, YouTube Channels, blogs, especially `Code Snips` and libraries that you've found useful for this project **OR** just in general!! You can never go wrong when sharing something that helped you learn a new concept || walked you through a difficult (but in my case mostly easy--am I right? gah!) task. This way, they won't get *as* lost nor be *as* unsolicited! Yay for **WOMEN WHO CODE**!! 

Who doesn't love a good tutorial right? 
**PS** feel free to leave your name and link to your GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, and the like whenever you add. 

## **To Add New Section...** 

I'm a bugger for syntax (or more accurately, consistent, user friendly, and fluidity for newbie coder and the like) so when adding a new section pretty please use a triple header (###) and write out the topic description and link to it in a numbered list format if you don't mind! :D If you have any detail or explanation please feel free to add to it in sub sections or bullet points! I just want the actual sections to be short and sweet and to the point for ease of use. 

If not, no problem! Just don't take it personally if I change it! 

###### ...not knowing how new anyone is it might be beneficial to look at [GitHub's MarkDown Syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) or [for some basic syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). For a full (albeit *exhaustive*) breakdown on all things MarkDown File related, check out the [MarkDownGuide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) for some **very** useful but also **very** thorough information. 

** but most importantly check this out [MarkDown Emoji Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md) and emoji freely(BUT responsibly)!!

# How To | Mark Down | => 

### **To Add New Section...** 

```md
Write out the topic as a HEADER that's related to your resource if not otherwise found by choosing a spot and using a double ## hashtag in a new line--
## You're Topic

And to post a named link it's just as simple! A bracket houses the displayed text/name of link [] and parenthesis () hold the link! This will be inline written inline, not on a seperate line like the previous. Like so --- []()

Now with text ---
[ My Link Text Here ]( www.I-am-a-link-but-hopefully-not.com ) but without spaces! :D 

[Your Link Text Here](www.GitHub.com)

Use * * to place emphasis to a letter, word, phrase, sentence, or paragraph using italics. 
I'm *emphasizing these* words but not these! 

Use ** ** to make any letter, word, phrase, sentence, or paragraph bold. 
This is an **example of bold text** in a sentence! 

It's all pretty straight forward from there! You can make numbered lists and bullet points with entering a 1(one) and a .(period) with a space after and boom you've started a numbered list that will increment on each enter!
1. 

And boom! You know your first format programming language!
