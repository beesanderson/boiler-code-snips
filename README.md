# Bridgette Sanderson's *personal* **OPEN SOURCE CodeSnip LIBRARY** 


Personal Code Snips for Ease of Use (&Access) ++to *ideally* avoid some **future** keyboard head smashes :D



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please feel free to browse my little personal **ever growing** code snip library and use, modify, or request to add to as you'd like. So far it is still in the beginning (AKA total infant, resource compilation, refactor, & format) stages but I will continue to add to it as my schedule permits-- 

**Anyway!** I am going through and compiling all of my little code snips, tutorials, and links (helps and *otherwise*!) I've made over the time I've started learning to code (June of 2021, writing this in December of 2021) as I just know they will be immensely helpful to any other code newbies out there like myself. Rest assure you there are *many* and the documentation is *bountiful* --- 

### ::-Full Disclosure-::
This is still an active work in progress (WIP) project as noted above but stressed below (*here*.) I am going to be making this project into a working RESTFUL API Web App so I can get all of these resources, blogs, guides, lists, and tips/tricks out there. This is one of my * passion projects * so I don't want to rush it but I do want to be direct & say this WILL be a working site ASAP. I don't want to use another *[Medium](https://medium.com/)* to share this content. I want to make the *medium* myself to showcase how its done...**where** its done if you catch my drift ;) 


## Table of Contents 
1. [CSS Table of Contents](/css-table-of-contents) - My personal T.O.C for CSS organization. Will create for other languages & formats.
2. [How to GitHub](/how-to-github) - My Guides, Tips'n'Tricks, HowTos, and Advice on GitHub and Git
3. [Resources'n'Helps](/resources-n-helps) - Generalized Dashboard of Helpful Links, Resources, Repos, and just good old folks
4. [Code Snips](/code-snips) - My *Personal* Code Snip Library (&& some recommended CodeSnip Libraries, hubba hubba)
5. [Cheat Sheets](/cheatsheets-shh)
6. []()
More coming soon...

### A bit about me...
I used to be an assistant Preschool & Kindergarten teacher which has *weirdly* taught me how to teach and (in previous management positions I've had,) train adults. I know what it's like to be (or **FEEL**) young, 'dumb,' and be terrified of what you have to do. That's overwhelming for anyone. Everyone knows what it's like to feel small, intimidated, and inadequate. There are a lot of us around you, *ahem yoooðŸ¤“*, who have made it one of our missions & goals in life to help teach what we know in a way that would have helped us while we, ourselves, were learning it. I hope to be able to do that one day. 

One of my goals is to become some sort of a coding Instructor one day to help others, especially women (single mothers in particular, especially with no family or paternal support nor presence) and their children become software developers. 


Honestly, and I mean **HONESTLY** if *I* can do it...*ANYONE* can.






### ::-Rules of Use-::
None! It would just be very kind of you to say my name or give a shout out if you do :) 

The typical OpenSource standards for now. I'll upload those shortly. Until then, none! It would just be very kind of you to say my name or give a shout out if you do use any of the code :) 

Basically, any kudos/shout outs are *always appreciated* AND most importantly **ALWAYS reciprocated**!!! 



#### Happy Coding and love to all my fellow DEVS!!! :D
