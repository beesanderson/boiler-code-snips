# Personal Code Snips for Ease of Access :D 

## Hey all! Bridgette Sanderson here ðŸ¥¸ ðŸ¤“ ðŸ˜¬

Please feel free to browse my little personal **ever growing** code snip library and use, modify, or request to add to as you'd like. So far it is still in the beginning (AKA total infant psh) stages but I will continue to add to it as my schedule permits-- 

(which is of course, rare *BUT* this is a priority to me so more often then not!) 


**Anyway!** I have to go through and compile all of my little code snips, tutorials, and links (helps and *otherwise*!) I've made over the time I've started learning to code (June of 2021, writing this in December of 2021) as I just know they will be immensley helpful to any other code newbies out there like myself. Rest assure you there are *many* and the documentation is *bountiful* --- 

### ::-Full Disclosure-::
I've been called a strange hybrid of [Leslie Knope, (from Parks and Recreation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Knope) and [Jessica Day, (from New Girl)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Day_(New_Girl)) more times then I can count...basically LEARNING IS FUN as are COMPUTERS! I **LOVE** binders, colors, office supplies, making "How Tos" and organization!! So, be prepared...you've been warned :D 

PS -- I'm also way cooler than that makes me sound...I swear... * sweats in hidden *

PPS- If you link to give me credit or shout outs that would be infinitely appreciated
but is totally not necessary! I'm still very new to the <DEV Community> 
and am in need of a job yesterday...or a month ago if you catch my drift. 
So any kudos is always appreciated AND most importantly ALWAYS reciprocated!!! 
Happy Coding and love to all my fellow DEVS!!! :D
